One of the best ways to avoid these fees is by using <strong>Norbert’s Gambit</strong>. In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to use Norbert’s Gambit on Questrade to efficiently convert CAD to USD and purchase US-listed ETFs like SPUS or HLAL within a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Open a Questrade Account</h2>\n<p>To get started, you need a Questrade account if you don’t already have one.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Visit the <a href=\"https://www.questrade.com/\">Questrade website</a>.</li>\n<li>Click on the \"Open an account\" button.</li>\n<li>Choose the account type you want to open. For this guide, we will focus on a <strong>Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)</strong>.</li>\n<li>Fill out the personal details such as name, address, and employment information.</li>\n<li>Upload the necessary identification documents.</li>\n<li>Submit your application.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Questrade typically approves accounts within a few days. Once you’re approved, you can log in and move to the next step.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Open a TFSA Account</h2>\n<p>If you didn’t open a TFSA during the signup process, you can do so after logging into your Questrade account.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to the <strong>Accounts</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Click on <strong>Open a New Account</strong>.</li>\n<li>Choose <strong>TFSA</strong>.</li>\n<li>Follow the prompts to complete the setup.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The TFSA allows for tax-free growth, making it an excellent option for long-term investing.</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Fund Your Account with CAD</h2>\n<p>Once your TFSA is open, you’ll need to fund it with CAD to start the Norbert’s Gambit process.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the main dashboard, click <strong>Fund Account</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select <strong>Add Funds</strong> and follow the prompts to transfer CAD from your bank account.</li>\n<li>It can take a few business days for the funds to appear in your Questrade account.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, you’re ready to convert CAD to USD.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Buy DLR.TO (Horizons US Dollar Currency ETF)</h2>\n<p>To perform Norbert’s Gambit, we use an ETF called DLR.TO. This ETF trades in CAD and tracks the US dollar, allowing us to convert CAD to USD without paying the usual currency conversion fees.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the <strong>Trading</strong> section in your Questrade account.</li>\n<li>Search for the ticker symbol <strong>DLR.TO</strong>.</li>\n<li>Buy an amount of DLR.TO that matches how much CAD you want to convert to USD. For example, if you want to convert $5,000 CAD to USD, buy $5,000 worth of DLR.TO shares.</li>\n<li>Submit your order.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It might take a few minutes to a day for the trade to be filled, depending on market conditions.</p>\n<h2>Step 5: Journal DLR.TO to DLR.U.TO (USD Variant)</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve purchased DLR.TO, you need to \"journal\" it to the USD version, DLR.U.TO. Questrade doesn't have an automatic way to do this online, so you’ll have to contact customer support.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open a support chat or call Questrade’s customer service.</li>\n<li>Ask them to <strong>journal your DLR.TO shares to DLR.U.TO</strong>. This process will convert your CAD-traded shares to USD-traded shares of the same ETF.</li>\n<li>The journal process typically takes 1-2 business days.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 6: Sell DLR.U.TO for USD</h2>\n<p>After the shares are journaled, you can sell DLR.U.TO to get USD in your TFSA.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your Questrade account and search for <strong>DLR.U.TO</strong>.</li>\n<li>Sell your shares of DLR.U.TO.</li>\n<li>You will now have USD in your TFSA, ready to purchase US stocks or ETFs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Step 7: Buy US-listed ETFs (SPUS or HLAL)</h2>\n<p>With USD in your account, you can now buy US-listed ETFs like SPUS (a Shariah-compliant ETF following the S&#x26;P 500) or HLAL (Wahed Invest’s Shariah-compliant ETF).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the <strong>Trading</strong> section.</li>\n<li>Search for the ticker symbol <strong>SPUS</strong> or <strong>HLAL</strong>.</li>\n<li>Place an order to buy the ETF of your choice using the USD you’ve converted.</li>\n<li>Confirm the trade.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Norbert’s Gambit is a great way to minimize currency conversion fees when investing in US stocks or ETFs through Questrade. With a bit of patience and some understanding of the process, you can save significantly over time—especially if you're a frequent investor in US markets.</p>\n<p>Make sure to monitor your contributions to stay within the <strong>TFSA contribution limits</strong> and always double-check with Questrade support if you're unsure about any step of the journaling process.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to convert CAD to USD to purchase US Stocks","date":"October 01, 2024","description":"This guide teaches you how to perform Norbert's gambit to convert CAD to USD so you can purchase USD ETFs like SPUS on Questrade."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2024-09-30-wshr/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Buy Your First Stock"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"32372c73-51b1-5ac7-a056-d1a9fb2925a2","previousPostId":"bfd8c4d4-97f9-5dda-8511-f24549215ae2","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
