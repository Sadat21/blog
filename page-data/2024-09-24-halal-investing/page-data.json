It would be irresponsible of me to just spend it, and I also learned that holding money in cash isn’t good because inflation would just decrease its value over time. So, I didn’t know what else to do.</p>\n<p>My friend, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-pho/\">Brian Pho</a>, taught me about investing in <strong>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</strong>. ETFs are basically a collection of stocks all rolled into one ticker. This is safer than buying a single company stock because even giants (like Nortel or BlackBerry) can collapse, but it’s going to be armageddon if the entire economy collapses. At that point, having a weak dollar might be the least of your worries.</p>\n<p><strong>Mutual funds</strong> are similar and are usually pitched to you by your local bank. They are a collection of stocks and <strong>bonds</strong>, which offer a guaranteed payout. Bonds are essentially debt instruments: companies or governments borrow your money and agree to pay a fixed percentage return over time, which is guaranteed. While this can provide stability, the return is considered <strong>interest</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Why Mutual Funds Are Not Shariah-Compliant</h3>\n<p>As a Muslim, I couldn’t purchase traditional mutual funds from my bank because of <strong>Riba</strong> (interest). Muslims are not allowed to partake in paying or receiving interest. Because mutual funds contain <strong>bonds</strong> (which inherently involve interest payments), they are not permissible in Islam. Bonds are essentially banks/companies taking out loans from you. They borrow your money and agree to pay you a fixed % return, which is interest. This is why traditional mutual funds are not compliant with Islamic principles.</p>\n<h3>Why S&#x26;P 500 Is Not Shariah-Compliant</h3>\n<p>Another common suggestion you might hear is to invest in the <strong>S&#x26;P 500</strong>, a collection of the 500 biggest public companies in the United States. It has historically had very good returns over the long run. However, as a Muslim, I cannot invest in this because it contains some companies that are not Shariah-compliant.</p>\n<p>Some examples of companies in the S&#x26;P 500 that are not Shariah-compliant include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>JP Morgan Chase</strong> (banking, interest-based revenue)</li>\n<li><strong>Altria Group</strong> (tobacco)</li>\n<li><strong>Anheuser-Busch</strong> (alcohol)</li>\n<li><strong>Las Vegas Sands</strong> (gambling)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These companies are involved in businesses prohibited in Islam, such as tobacco, alcohol, banks (due to interest), and gambling.</p>\n<h3>Halal Alternatives</h3>\n<p>There is, however, <a href=\"https://www.sp-funds.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Factsheet-Dec-31-2020-SPUS-Broad.pdf\"><strong>SPUS</strong></a>, which is a collection of all S&#x26;P 500 companies minus the non-Shariah-compliant ones, catered specifically for Muslim investors.</p>\n<p>During my research, I came across <strong>Wealthsimple</strong>, which offers managed portfolios that are Shariah-compliant and tailored towards Muslims. They published a great article about their <strong>Halal Portfolio</strong>, which you can check out <a href=\"https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/managed-investing/halal-portfolio\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m glad Wealthsimple recognized the growing Muslim demographic in Canada and created a portfolio to serve our needs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Future Topics to Cover</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Norbert’s Gambit</strong>: A way to invest in ETFs and companies traded in USD.</li>\n<li><strong>TFSA vs RRSP vs FHSA vs Non-Registered Accounts</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Crypto</strong>: Should you have exposure to it?</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Guide to Investing with Islamic Principles","date":"September 29, 2024","description":"How to invest while adhering to Islamic principles, tailored for young Muslims starting their careers."}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2024-09-30-wshr/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Buy Your First Stock"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a5cba6db-76fd-5502-9718-d0b2bfda3e16","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"bfd8c4d4-97f9-5dda-8511-f24549215ae2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
