It would be irresponsible of me to just spend it, and I also learned that holding money in cash isn’t good because inflation would just decrease its value over time. So, I didn’t know what else to do.</p>\n<p>My friend, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-pho/\">Brian Pho</a>, taught me about investing in <strong>Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</strong>. ETFs are basically a collection of stocks all rolled into one ticker. This is safer than buying a single company stock because even giants (like Nortel or BlackBerry) can collapse, but it’s going to be armageddon if the entire economy collapses. At that point, having a weak dollar might be the least of your worries.</p>\n<p><strong>Mutual funds</strong> are similar and are usually pitched to you by your local bank. They are a collection of stocks and <strong>bonds</strong>, which offer a guaranteed payout. Bonds are essentially debt instruments: companies or governments borrow your money and agree to pay a fixed percentage return over time, which is guaranteed. While this can provide stability, the return is considered <strong>interest</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Why Mutual Funds Are Not Shariah-Compliant</h3>\n<p>As a Muslim, I couldn’t purchase traditional mutual funds from my bank because of <strong>Riba</strong> (interest). Muslims are not allowed to partake in paying or receiving interest. Because mutual funds contain <strong>bonds</strong> (which inherently involve interest payments), they are not permissible in Islam. Bonds are essentially banks/companies taking out loans from you. They borrow your money and agree to pay you a fixed % return, which is interest. This is why traditional mutual funds are not compliant with Islamic principles.</p>\n<h3>Why S&#x26;P 500 Is Not Shariah-Compliant</h3>\n<p>Another common suggestion you might hear is to invest in the <strong>S&#x26;P 500</strong>, a collection of the 500 biggest public companies in the United States. It has historically had very good returns over the long run. However, as a Muslim, I cannot invest in this because it contains some companies that are not Shariah-compliant.</p>\n<p>Some examples of companies in the S&#x26;P 500 that are not Shariah-compliant include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>JP Morgan Chase</strong> (banking, interest-based revenue)</li>\n<li><strong>Altria Group</strong> (tobacco)</li>\n<li><strong>Anheuser-Busch</strong> (alcohol)</li>\n<li><strong>Las Vegas Sands</strong> (gambling)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These companies are involved in businesses prohibited in Islam, such as tobacco, alcohol, banks (due to interest), and gambling.</p>\n<h3>Halal Alternatives</h3>\n<p>There is, however, <a href=\"https://www.sp-funds.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Factsheet-Dec-31-2020-SPUS-Broad.pdf\"><strong>SPUS</strong></a>, which is a collection of all S&#x26;P 500 companies minus the non-Shariah-compliant ones, catered specifically for Muslim investors.</p>\n<p>During my research, I came across <strong>Wealthsimple</strong>, which offers managed portfolios that are Shariah-compliant and tailored towards Muslims. They published a great article about their <strong>Halal Portfolio</strong>, which you can check out <a href=\"https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/managed-investing/halal-portfolio\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I’m glad Wealthsimple recognized the growing Muslim demographic in Canada and created a portfolio to serve our needs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Crash Course on What to Do</h3>\n<p>Here's a quick step-by-step guide. I’ll dive into more detail in future blog posts if there is interest.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open a Wealthsimple account</strong> using my referral code <strong>VZP-FW</strong>. It’ll give both of us a small gift (as of writing, it’s $25 or $10,000 managed for free for a year).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open a TFSA account</strong>. TFSA stands for <strong>Tax-Free Savings Account</strong>, which is a special account where you don’t have to pay any tax on any gains made within the account. However, there is a limit on how much you can contribute. You unlock more contribution room on January 1st each year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: If you turned 18 in 2023, your contribution room for that year would be $6,500. For 2024, the contribution limit has increased to <strong>$7,000</strong>, giving you a total of <strong>$13,500</strong> in contribution space if you haven’t yet contributed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can check past contribution limits on this <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html\">CRA website</a>.</p>\n<p>Always make sure you don’t exceed your contribution limit, or you’ll face fees from the government.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Withdrawals</strong>: You can withdraw money from a TFSA without penalties, but you won’t be able to re-contribute that amount until the following year when the limit refreshes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: Let's say you have <strong>$10,000</strong> in your TFSA, and in <strong>June 2024</strong>, you decide to withdraw <strong>$5,000</strong> for an emergency. You can withdraw the money without any penalties, but you cannot re-contribute that <strong>$5,000</strong> until <strong>January 1st, 2025</strong>, when your TFSA limit resets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your contribution room for 2024 was <strong>$7,000</strong> (and you’ve already maxed it out), in 2025, you would get back the <strong>$5,000</strong> you withdrew, plus the new contribution room for that year. So, if the 2025 contribution limit is <strong>$7,000</strong>, you would now have <strong>$12,000</strong> available to contribute in 2025.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don't open a managed account</strong>. Instead, open a self-directed account. The Halal Portfolio is now just a single ETF, <strong>WSHR</strong>, and Gold. In my opinion, it’s not worth paying the extra 0.5% management fee to Wealthsimple when you can easily buy it yourself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Determine your TFSA contribution space</strong> and figure out how much you can realistically invest by the end of the year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I started investing in my early 20s, so I had a large contribution space, but I was nowhere close to maxing it out. I was new to investing and paranoid, so I didn’t feel comfortable putting in a large sum of money all at once. Instead, I automated a contribution of <strong>$50/week</strong> into my TFSA. Wealthsimple lets you automate this process, so you don’t need to do it manually.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Build the habit</strong> of investing regularly. The amount you put in weekly/monthly doesn’t matter as long as you don’t over-contribute. It’s just important to get started. This will help calm your nerves about the new process.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I like investing weekly because it allows me to <strong>dollar cost average</strong> (a way to reduce risk by spreading out investments over time, which I’ll explain in a future blog post).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>And there you go, you are now investing in your future in an Islamically-minded way!</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Future Topics to Cover</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Norbert’s Gambit</strong>: A way to invest in ETFs and companies traded in USD.</li>\n<li><strong>TFSA vs RRSP vs FHSA vs Non-Registered Accounts</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Crypto</strong>: Should you have exposure to it?</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Guide to Investing with Islamic Principles","date":"September 29, 2024","description":"How to invest while adhering to Islamic principles, tailored for young Muslims starting their careers."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/first-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"First Post"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"a5cba6db-76fd-5502-9718-d0b2bfda3e16","previousPostId":"bff97eb6-dc64-5e78-ae67-7497c6420759","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
