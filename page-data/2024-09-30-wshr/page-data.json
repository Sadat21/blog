It’ll give both of us a small gift (as of writing, it’s $25 or $10,000 managed for free for a year).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open a TFSA account</strong>. TFSA stands for <strong>Tax-Free Savings Account</strong>, which is a special account where you don’t have to pay any tax on any gains made within the account. However, there is a limit on how much you can contribute. You unlock more contribution room on January 1st each year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: If you turned 18 in 2023, your contribution room for that year would be $6,500. For 2024, the contribution limit has increased to <strong>$7,000</strong>, giving you a total of <strong>$13,500</strong> in contribution space if you haven’t yet contributed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can check past contribution limits on this <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html\">CRA website</a>.</p>\n<p>Always make sure you don’t exceed your contribution limit, or you’ll face fees from the government.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Withdrawals</strong>: You can withdraw money from a TFSA without penalties, but you won’t be able to re-contribute that amount until the following year when the limit refreshes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Example</strong>: Let's say you have <strong>$10,000</strong> in your TFSA, and in <strong>June 2024</strong>, you decide to withdraw <strong>$5,000</strong> for an emergency. You can withdraw the money without any penalties, but you cannot re-contribute that <strong>$5,000</strong> until <strong>January 1st, 2025</strong>, when your TFSA limit resets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your contribution room for 2024 was <strong>$7,000</strong> (and you’ve already maxed it out), in 2025, you would get back the <strong>$5,000</strong> you withdrew, plus the new contribution room for that year. So, if the 2025 contribution limit is <strong>$7,000</strong>, you would now have <strong>$12,000</strong> available to contribute in 2025.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Don't open a managed account</strong>. Instead, open a self-directed account. The Halal Portfolio is now just a single ETF, <strong>WSHR</strong>, and Gold. In my opinion, it’s not worth paying the extra 0.5% management fee to Wealthsimple when you can easily buy it yourself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Determine your TFSA contribution space</strong> and figure out how much you can realistically invest by the end of the year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I started investing in my early 20s, so I had a large contribution space, but I was nowhere close to maxing it out. I was new to investing and paranoid, so I didn’t feel comfortable putting in a large sum of money all at once. Instead, I automated a contribution of <strong>$50/week</strong> into my TFSA. Wealthsimple lets you automate this process, so you don’t need to do it manually.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Build the habit</strong> of investing regularly. The amount you put in weekly/monthly doesn’t matter as long as you don’t over-contribute. It’s just important to get started. This will help calm your nerves about the new process.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I like investing weekly because it allows me to <strong>dollar cost average</strong> (a way to reduce risk by spreading out investments over time, which I’ll explain in a future blog post).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p>And there you go, you are now investing in your future in an Islamically-minded way!</p>\n<hr>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Buy Your First Stock","date":"September 30, 2024","description":"Everything you need to know to purchase your first halal ETF (WSHR) on WealthSimple."}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2024-09-24-halal-investing/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Guide to Investing with Islamic Principles"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2024-10-01-spus-hlal/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to Convert CAD to USD to Purchase US Stocks"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bfd8c4d4-97f9-5dda-8511-f24549215ae2","previousPostId":"a5cba6db-76fd-5502-9718-d0b2bfda3e16","nextPostId":"32372c73-51b1-5ac7-a056-d1a9fb2925a2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"],"slicesMap":{}}
