# DRAFT POST IN PROGRESS

Here's a quick step-by-step guide on how to open up your WealthSimple account and purchase your first stock.

1. **Open a Wealthsimple account** using my referral code **VZP-FW**. It’ll give both of us a small gift (as of writing, it’s $25 or $10,000 managed for free for a year).

2. **Open a TFSA account**. TFSA stands for **Tax-Free Savings Account**, which is a special account where you don’t have to pay any tax on any gains made within the account. However, there is a limit on how much you can contribute. You unlock more contribution room on January 1st each year.

    - **Example**: If you turned 18 in 2023, your contribution room for that year would be $6,500. For 2024, the contribution limit has increased to **$7,000**, giving you a total of **$13,500** in contribution space if you haven’t yet contributed.

   You can check past contribution limits on this [CRA website](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html).

   Always make sure you don’t exceed your contribution limit, or you’ll face fees from the government.

    - **Withdrawals**: You can withdraw money from a TFSA without penalties, but you won’t be able to re-contribute that amount until the following year when the limit refreshes.

        - **Example**: Let's say you have **$10,000** in your TFSA, and in **June 2024**, you decide to withdraw **$5,000** for an emergency. You can withdraw the money without any penalties, but you cannot re-contribute that **$5,000** until **January 1st, 2025**, when your TFSA limit resets.

      If your contribution room for 2024 was **$7,000** (and you’ve already maxed it out), in 2025, you would get back the **$5,000** you withdrew, plus the new contribution room for that year. So, if the 2025 contribution limit is **$7,000**, you would now have **$12,000** available to contribute in 2025.

3. **Don't open a managed account**. Instead, open a self-directed account. The Halal Portfolio is now just a single ETF, **WSHR**, and Gold. In my opinion, it’s not worth paying the extra 0.5% management fee to Wealthsimple when you can easily buy it yourself.

4. **Determine your TFSA contribution space** and figure out how much you can realistically invest by the end of the year.

    - I started investing in my early 20s, so I had a large contribution space, but I was nowhere close to maxing it out. I was new to investing and paranoid, so I didn’t feel comfortable putting in a large sum of money all at once. Instead, I automated a contribution of **$50/week** into my TFSA. Wealthsimple lets you automate this process, so you don’t need to do it manually.

5. **Build the habit** of investing regularly. The amount you put in weekly/monthly doesn’t matter as long as you don’t over-contribute. It’s just important to get started. This will help calm your nerves about the new process.

    - I like investing weekly because it allows me to **dollar cost average** (a way to reduce risk by spreading out investments over time, which I’ll explain in a future blog post).

And there you go, you are now investing in your future in an Islamically-minded way!
