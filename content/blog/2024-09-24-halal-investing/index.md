## A Guide to Investing with Islamic Principles

This guide is tailored towards young Muslim men and women starting their careers, but the advice can apply to anyone.

When I started my first internship, it was the first time I made a substantial amount of money, and I didn’t know what to do with it. It would be irresponsible of me to just spend it, and I also learned that holding money in cash isn’t good because inflation would just decrease its value over time. So, I didn’t know what else to do.

My friend, [Brian Pho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-pho/), taught me about investing in **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)**. ETFs are basically a collection of stocks all rolled into one ticker. This is safer than buying a single company stock because even giants (like Nortel or BlackBerry) can collapse, but it’s going to be armageddon if the entire economy collapses. At that point, having a weak dollar might be the least of your worries.

**Mutual funds** are similar and are usually pitched to you by your local bank. They are a collection of stocks and **bonds**, which offer a guaranteed payout. Bonds are essentially debt instruments: companies or governments borrow your money and agree to pay a fixed percentage return over time, which is guaranteed. While this can provide stability, the return is considered **interest**.

### Why Mutual Funds Are Not Shariah-Compliant

As a Muslim, I couldn’t purchase traditional mutual funds from my bank because of **Riba** (interest). Muslims are not allowed to partake in paying or receiving interest. Because mutual funds contain **bonds** (which inherently involve interest payments), they are not permissible in Islam. Bonds are essentially banks/companies taking out loans from you. They borrow your money and agree to pay you a fixed % return, which is interest. This is why traditional mutual funds are not compliant with Islamic principles.

### Why S&P 500 Is Not Shariah-Compliant

Another common suggestion you might hear is to invest in the **S&P 500**, a collection of the 500 biggest public companies in the United States. It has historically had very good returns over the long run. However, as a Muslim, I cannot invest in this because it contains some companies that are not Shariah-compliant.

Some examples of companies in the S&P 500 that are not Shariah-compliant include:

- **JP Morgan Chase** (banking, interest-based revenue)
- **Altria Group** (tobacco)
- **Anheuser-Busch** (alcohol)
- **Las Vegas Sands** (gambling)

These companies are involved in businesses prohibited in Islam, such as tobacco, alcohol, banks (due to interest), and gambling.

### Halal Alternatives

There is, however, [**SPUS**](https://www.sp-funds.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Factsheet-Dec-31-2020-SPUS-Broad.pdf), which is a collection of all S&P 500 companies minus the non-Shariah-compliant ones, catered specifically for Muslim investors.

During my research, I came across **Wealthsimple**, which offers managed portfolios that are Shariah-compliant and tailored towards Muslims. They published a great article about their **Halal Portfolio**, which you can check out [here](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/managed-investing/halal-portfolio).

I’m glad Wealthsimple recognized the growing Muslim demographic in Canada and created a portfolio to serve our needs.

### Crash Course on What to Do

Here's a quick step-by-step guide. I’ll dive into more detail in future blog posts if there is interest.

1. **Open a Wealthsimple account** using my referral code **VZP-FW**. It’ll give both of us a small gift (as of writing, it’s $25 or $10,000 managed for free for a year).

2. **Open a TFSA account**. TFSA stands for **Tax-Free Savings Account**, which is a special account where you don’t have to pay any tax on any gains made within the account. However, there is a limit on how much you can contribute. You unlock more contribution room on January 1st each year.

   - **Example**: If you turned 18 in 2023, your contribution room for that year would be $6,500. For 2024, the contribution limit has increased to **$7,000**, giving you a total of **$13,500** in contribution space if you haven’t yet contributed.

   You can check past contribution limits on this [CRA website](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html).

   Always make sure you don’t exceed your contribution limit, or you’ll face fees from the government.

   - **Withdrawals**: You can withdraw money from a TFSA without penalties, but you won’t be able to re-contribute that amount until the following year when the limit refreshes.

      - **Example**: Let's say you have **$10,000** in your TFSA, and in **June 2024**, you decide to withdraw **$5,000** for an emergency. You can withdraw the money without any penalties, but you cannot re-contribute that **$5,000** until **January 1st, 2025**, when your TFSA limit resets.

     If your contribution room for 2024 was **$7,000** (and you’ve already maxed it out), in 2025, you would get back the **$5,000** you withdrew, plus the new contribution room for that year. So, if the 2025 contribution limit is **$7,000**, you would now have **$12,000** available to contribute in 2025.

3. **Don't open a managed account**. Instead, open a self-directed account. The Halal Portfolio is now just a single ETF, **WSHR**, and Gold. In my opinion, it’s not worth paying the extra 0.5% management fee to Wealthsimple when you can easily buy it yourself.

4. **Determine your TFSA contribution space** and figure out how much you can realistically invest by the end of the year.

   - I started investing in my early 20s, so I had a large contribution space, but I was nowhere close to maxing it out. I was new to investing and paranoid, so I didn’t feel comfortable putting in a large sum of money all at once. Instead, I automated a contribution of **$50/week** into my TFSA. Wealthsimple lets you automate this process, so you don’t need to do it manually.

5. **Build the habit** of investing regularly. The amount you put in weekly/monthly doesn’t matter as long as you don’t over-contribute. It’s just important to get started. This will help calm your nerves about the new process.

   - I like investing weekly because it allows me to **dollar cost average** (a way to reduce risk by spreading out investments over time, which I’ll explain in a future blog post).

And there you go, you are now investing in your future in an Islamically-minded way!
